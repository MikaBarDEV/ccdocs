# Ratelimit

Since Discord Bots have Ratelimit.Some of the Custom Commands functions gets rejected or the cooldown gets increased.That is quite annonying but we have to add this standard so the bot does not hit the api. There is the possibilty to decrease cooldown and more therefore contact me  `RAKE#6882`
