# Trigger/Events

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is a trigger?**  
The trigger starts an execution of a custom command. If it meets specific requirements it will trigger the command  
{% endhint %}

## All triggertypes/events 

* Message : triggers if a User sends a message 
* Reaction: triggers if a User reacts on a message
* Join/leave: triggers if a User joins or leaves your Server
* Interval: triggers on a provided interval
* Timed: triggers on a provided Time/Date
* Voice join/leave: triggers if a User joins/leaves a voice channel

The trigger are highly configurable.So you can select **Message** as triggertype and **!help** as trigger. Which would trigger the Custom Command,if a user uses **!help.**

## Message

message trigger supports

* Exact Match
* [Regex](https://www.sitepoint.com/learn-regex/)
* Starts with \(you need a \| after your trigger\)

#### Regex

It would trigger, if the user sends hello

![execute it if the regex matches with it](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2814%29.png)

#### Exact Match

The Message must be same as the trigger 

![execute it if the msg is hello will not work if the message is hello Rake](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2812%29.png)

#### Starts with \| Command

like for example for a kick command you need arguments .!kick @Rake .So @Rake would be the first argument 

![execute it if the message starts with hello](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2823%29.png)
